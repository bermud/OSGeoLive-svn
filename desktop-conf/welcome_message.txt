Welcome to the OSGeo Live GIS DVD.


See the road-sign Help icon on the Desktop for
information about the Live disc and virtual-machine,
including a synopsis of bundled geospatial packages
and a series of quick-start short tutorials.

Program installers for Macintosh OSX and Microsoft
Windows can be found in the MacInstallers and
WindowsInstallers directories.

Passwords for various things can be found in the
passwords.txt file on the Desktop.

If you need to become "root" (the UNIX super-user)
open a Terminal and type "sudo su", then password="user".

The living FAQ can be found here:

Happy mapping!
