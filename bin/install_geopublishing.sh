# About:
# =====
# This script will install the geopublishing.deb which contains the AtlasStyler SLD editor and the Geopublisher application. It will also
# download the openmapsymbols for AtlasStyler to the local ~/.AtlasStyler/templates directory.

# Running:
# =======
# "atlasstyler" or "geopublisher" or Application -> Science -> Geopublisher/AtlasStyler

# Requirements:
# =======
# Latest Sun JRE 1.6 

# Get the sources list file (may overwrite existing sources file, but that is no problem)
# Uses lsb_release so that the script will run unchanged for "lucid" and later versions of ubuntu/debian
apt-get install --yes lsb-release
wget -nv --output-document="/etc/apt/sources.list.d/geopublishing.list" \
   "http://www.geopublishing.org/sources.list.d/$(lsb_release -cs).list"

# Get and import the key that the .deb packages are signed with
apt-key adv --keyserver keyserver.ubuntu.com --recv-keys 7450D04751B576FD

# Install Geopublisher and AtlasStyler and documentation
apt-get update --yes
apt-get install --yes --no-install-recommends geopublishing geopublishing-doc

# The above was simple : just installing .deb

# Now we download some predefined symbols for atlasstyler because the user is probably off-line
