OSGeo Windows installers

 by Alex Mandel

TO INSTALL:
To install the application simply double click on the appropriate exe or
unzip a zip and read the README for each application. Some applications
have a 64bit version but only 32bit have been included here for
compatibility, check the web for newer or alternate versions. For more
information about the projects please read the help included in the live
disc or visit http://live.osgeo.org

osgeo4w-setup-*.exe is an application to help you install applications on
MS Windows. Some of the same applications included here are also available
via OSGeo4W. The OSGeo4W tool includes the ability to manage upgrades,
install additional libraries and ensure compatability between mulitple
applications. Visit http://trac.osgeo.org/osgeo4w/ for more information.


Happy Mapping!
