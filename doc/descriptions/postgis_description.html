<h1>PostGIS</h1>
<h2>What is PostGIS?</h2>
<p>
PostGIS adds support for geographic objects to the <a href="http://www.postgresql.com/">PostgreSQL</a>
object-relational database. In effect, PostGIS "spatially enables" the
PostgreSQL server, allowing it to be used as a backend spatial database
for geographic information systems (GIS), much like ESRI's SDE or Oracle's Spatial extension. 
PostGIS follows the <a href="http://www.opengis.org/">OpenGIS</a> "<a href="http://www.opengis.org/docs/99-049.pdf">Simple Features Specification for SQL</a>" and has been <a href="http://postgis.refractions.net/files/opengis-certification.png" target="certification">certified as compliant</a> with the "Types and Functions" profile.

<h2>About</h2>
<p>
PostGIS has been developed by <a href="http://www.refractions.net/">Refractions Research</a> as a project in <a href="http://www.opensource.org/docs/osd">open source</a> spatial database technology. 
PostGIS is released under the <a href="http://www.opensource.org/licenses/gpl-2.0.php">GNU General Public License</a>. We continue to develop PostGIS, and have added <a href="http://udig.refractions.net/">user interface tools</a>, basic topology support, data validation, coordinate transformation, programming APIs and much more.
Our list of future projects includes full topology support, raster support, networks and routing, three dimensional surfaces, curves and splines and other features.  <a href="mailto:info@refractions.net">Ask us</a> about <a href="http://www.refractions.net/products/postgis/">consulting services</a> and implementing new features.

<h2>Using Postgis</h2>
You can connect and use the database from many programs included here. Connections are setup already in:
<ul>
	<li>Pgadmin3</li>
	<li>QGIS</li>
</ul>
To connect from other applications you'll need the following information:
<ul>
	<li>Server: localhost or 127.0.0.1</li>
	<li>Port: 5432</li>
	<li>User/Password: user/user</li>
	<li>Database: medford or sydney</li>
</ul>


<h2>Case Studies</h2>
<p>Learn how PostGIS is being used around the world.</p>
<p class="listitem-title"><a href="http://postgis.refractions.net/documentation/casestudies/casoil/">UC Davis Soil Resource Laboratory</a></p>
<p class="listitem-description">The US Davis Soil Resource Laboratory
publishes soil inventory data for the southwest United States using
PostGIS and Mapserver. Six months ago they were using shape files for
spatial data storage. With PostGIS, their data is integrated in the
database and new avenues of display and analysis have been opened for
them.</p>

<p class="listitem-title"><a href="http://postgis.refractions.net/documentation/casestudies/2008-09-rento/">Natural Language Spatial Search Engine for Rental Places &#8211; Rento</a></p>
<p class="listitem-description">Rento is a free web service that makes
it easy to find a place to rent in Greece. Powered by PostgreSQL and
PostGIS, it provides ad listings with photographs displayed on a map.
Searching is accomplished through map navigation and natural language
processing, with the search engine being capable of answering complex
(spatial) questions such as "flat near the University of Athens" or
"loft up to 800 euros near a metro station" (in greek).</p>

<p class="listitem-title"><a href="http://postgis.refractions.net/documentation/casestudies/globexplorer/">GlobeXplorer</a></p>
<p class="listitem-description">GlobeXplorer serves terrabytes of
imagery to clients around the world using PostGIS as their production
database server. In 2004, GlobeXplorer migrated from Informix to
PostGIS, and now they are serving over a million requests a day with
PostGIS.</p>
