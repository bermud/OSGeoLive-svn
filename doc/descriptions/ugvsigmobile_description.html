<h1><font color="#c06f0a">Unofficial gvSIG Mobile for Linux devices v. 0.1.6</font></h1>

<p>This is a brief description of the application. For more details, visit:<br><br>

<h2>Starting the application</h2>
<p>There should be an icon under <em>Applications - Education</em> to start this application.
You can also start it by typing <em>ugvsigmo</em> in a Linux terminal.

<h2>Features</h2>
<p>gvSIG Mobile for Openmoko v. 0.1.6 is a GPS-enabled, projection-aware mapping application that also allows
user to store waypoints with easily customizable attributes and perform remote vector synchronization
(see <a href="http://gvsigmobileonopenmoko.wordpress.com/download">How-tos section</a> for details).
Other features include:

<ul>
	<li>Browsing Spherical Mercator remote tile services (OpenStreetMap and similar).</li>
	<li>Easily configurable access to standard and tile WMS servers. If the WMS server
	is not a tile server, the application applies a tile approach. This optimizes bandwidth
	usage in all cases.</li>
	<li>Easily configurable access to ESRI ArcIMS servers. The application applies a tile approach.
	This optimizes bandwidth usage in all cases.</li>
	<li>Support for the vector data file de facto standard (ESRI shapefile, *.shp).</li>
	<li>Access to GPS device via Gpsd. A rotating arrow shows on the map indicating position and
	heading. Coordinates are also shown.</li>
	<li>Easily configurable waypoints dialog to store waypoints in a small embedded database which
	can be synchronized with a remote PostGIS database.</li>
	<li>Multi-language. Currently: English, Spanish, Romanian, Italian, French, German, Arabic,
	Russian &amp; Hebrew. Special thanks to
	the <a href="http://www.oadigital.net">OA Digital staff</a> and also to Evgeniy Ginzburg,
	Michael Douchin and Nawfal Cherqui.</li>
</ul>

<h3>Projections</h3>

If the user wishes to see the GPS arrow on their cartography, they must access WMS
layers and add shapefiles using one of the coordinate systems known by the application.
These can be seen in the SRS drop-down combo box (settings tab). Supported coordinate
systems include:

<ul>
	<li><em>EPSG:4326:</em> Geographic coordinates for WGS84 datum.</li>
	<li><em>EPSG:3857:</em> (aka EPSG:900913) Spherical Mercator,
	used by OSM, Yahoo Satellites, Google Maps, etc.</li>
	<li><em>EPSG:258XX:</em> UTM projection for European zones (ETRS89 datum).</li>
	<li><em>EPSG:27700:</em> British national grid.</li>
</ul>

<h3>Tiles</h3>

Tiles and other data are cached in the user's home folder,
usually <tt>/home/[user]/ugvsigmobile_session</tt>

<h2>Background</h2>
<p>The gvSIG and gvSIG Mobile projects are funded by the Conselleria d'Infraestructures i Transports
(Generalitat Valenciana, Spain) and developed by Prodevelop SL,
Iver and Instituto Robotica (UV):<br><br><a href="http://www.gvsig.gva.es">http://www.gvsig.gva.es</a>

<p>gvSIG Mobile is a JME-CDC GIS application that runs on pocket PCs and smartphones. The official
version runs so far only on Windows Mobile.

<p>In summer 2008, Joseph Reeves from <a href="http://www.oadigital.net">Oxford Archaeology</a>
showed great interest in using gvSIG Mobile
on <a href="http://wiki.openmoko.org/wiki/Main_Page">Openmoko</a>, a Linux-based operating system used
on a new phone called Neo Freerunner. So I started to create an unofficial version with a new GUI (simpler
and more finger-oriented), based on the not-so-mature Java resources available on Openmoko. This software
is now available in an initial beta version so that we can receive some feed-back from users.
