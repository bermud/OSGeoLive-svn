<h1>Kosmo 1.2.1</h1>
<p>
  <a href="http://www.opengis.es">Kosmo - Desktop</a> is a general Desktop-GIS. Using extra extensions allows customizing it for specific purposes. 
  It is designed for the average GIS user, with special emphasis on user-friendly interface (quite similar to the most famous and wide used commercial desktop GIS). 
  It is open source and provides users with the most useful tools to explore, edit and analyze spatial data. All of it by observing the OpenGIS standards and applying high efforts 
  to maintain the data topology quality. It is the first component of a series of developments oriented to be a complete spatial data infrastructure that will be made available to the
  entire community.<br/><br/>
