<h1>Geomajas</h1>
<p><a href="http://www.geomajas.org/">Geomajas</a> is the extensible open source web mapping framework, enabling integrated GIS solutions for businesses and government. It has an integrated <b>client-server</b> architecture, with a high focus on <b>server-side integration</b> of your data (be it through GeoTools or Hibernate). This means that you apply your security and business logic on the server before anything gets send to the client, resulting in robust applications and a <b>real thin client</b>.</p>
