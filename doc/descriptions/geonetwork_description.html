<h1>GeoNetwork 2.4.1</h1>
<h2>What is GeoNetwork</h2>
  <a href="http://geonetwork-opensource.org/">GeoNetwork</a> is a Java-based software server that provides the following capabilities:
<ul>
	<li><u>a catalog of information about datasets and other resources;</u> users can view and edit this information and store it using a variety of standards such as ISO19115</li>
	<li><u>harvesting and searching information in remote catalogs;</u> GeoNetwork can participate in a distributed system of catalogs using standards such as OAI-PMH, OGC CSW and Z3950.
	<li><u>view styled maps served by OGC Web Map Servers;</u> users can not only create and view these maps, they can generate pdf output, annotate the maps with 'pushpin' notes and save their maps for sharing as standard OGC web map contexts</li>
</ul>
<p>GeoNetwork also incorporates GeoServer, an open source Java data server.
</p>
<p>
GeoNetwork makes data discovery and sharing, easy! 
</p>
<h2>Technologies and Standards</h2>
<p>
GeoNetwork uses a variety of open source libraries such as Lucene and JDOM. It uses standards based protocols from organisations such as the Open Geospatial Consortium (OGC), who have made the GeoNetwork implementation of its Catalog Service (CSW) the reference implementation. It uses modern technologies such as XML and XSLT.
</p>
<h2>Free and Open Source Software</h2>
<p>
  GeoNetwork is free software. This significantly lowers the financial barrier to entry when compared to traditional GIS Catalog products. Not only is it available free of charge, it is also open source. Bug fixes and feature improvements in open source software are greatly accelerated when compared to traditional software solutions. Using GeoNetwork in your organization also prevents software lock-in, saving costly legacy support contracts.
</p>
<h2>Join the Community</h2>
<p>
 GeoNetwork has a large and vibrant community consisting of users and developers from all over the world. Support is available through a variety of sources, such as email lists and IRC (the latter with real time access to software developers). 
</p>
<h2>Running GeoNetwork</h2>
<p>
  To run GeoNetwork on the Live DVD, click on the "Start GeoNetwork" link on the desktop. Wait a few seconds and then click on the "GeoNetwork" icon. A web browser window will then open pointing to the GeoNetwork main page.
