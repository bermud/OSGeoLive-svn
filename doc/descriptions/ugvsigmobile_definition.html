    <p>
This is a partial port of gvSIG Mobile, which currently is supported only by Windows Mobile devices.
It runs on Linux-based devices such as the Neo Freerunner phone
or the Nokia N8X0 tablets. This R&amp;D project intends to explore the portability of gvSIG Mobile's code.
It lacks plenty of
gvSIG Mobile's features but includes some interesting new capabilities.
