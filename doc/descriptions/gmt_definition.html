    Tools)
    <p>
    GMT is a collection of tools for manipulating geographic and
    Cartesian data sets and producing illustrations ranging from simple
    x-y plots via contour maps to artificially illuminated surfaces and
    3-D perspective views. GMT supports numerous map projections and
    transformations and comes with support data such as coastlines,
    rivers, and political boundaries.
