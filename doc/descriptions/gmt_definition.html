    Tools)
    <p>
    <a href="http://gmt.soest.hawaii.edu/">GMT</a> is a collection of ~60
    tools for manipulating geographic and Cartesian data sets (including
    filtering, trend fitting, gridding, projecting, etc.) and producing
    Encapsulated PostScript File (EPS) illustrations ranging from simple
    x-y plots via contour maps to artificially illuminated surfaces and
    3-D perspective views. GMT supports ~30 map projections and
    transformations and comes with support data such as GSHHS coastlines,
    rivers, and political boundaries.
