GpsDrive is a car (bike, ship, plane, foot) navigation system.
GpsDrive displays your position provided from a GPS on a zoomable map,
the map file is autoselected depending on your position and preferred
map scale.  All GPS receivers which support the NMEA protocol should
be usable, as well as many USB GPSs using a binary protocol known to
the <a href="http://gpsd.berlios.de">Gpsd</a> daemon.
