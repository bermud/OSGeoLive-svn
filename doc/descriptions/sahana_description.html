<h2>About</h2>
<p>
  <a href="http://www.sahanafoundation.org">Sahana</a> is a Free and Open
	Source Disaster Management system. It is a web based collaboration
	tool that addresses the common coordination problems during a
	disaster from finding missing people, managing aid, managing
	volunteers, tracking camps effectively between Government groups,
	the civil society (NGOs) and the victims themselves.

<h2>Running</h2>

 <h4>Installation</h4>
  When you first start Sahana you'll be taken to a web setup page.
  Most of this has been done for you, so on the first page you can
  just click "Next >" at the bottom, and on the second setup page you
  can click on "Setup Database >" at the very bottom of the page without
  changing any of the form entries.
  <p>
  On the third setup page you'll be asked to set up some passwords, and
  it insists on strong ones, e.g. "demo4osgeo" for all of them. Also
  on this page you for the purposes of the demo should leave Access Control
  set as "Disabled". Finish by clicking the "Write Configuration File >" button
  at the bottom of the page. This will give you a security warning (only important
  if you intend to install from the live demo DVD), and a button to "Start
  Sahana" which you will want to click.

 <h4>Usage</h4>
<!--
  This section is somewhat TODO.
 -->

  An easy way to get started is by adding a detail artifact. From the main
  menu on the left click on Situation Mapping, "Add Situation Markers", and
  add some information about a sample detail. You'll then be able to view
  and select this with the "Situation Map" link in the upper left corner
  of the page.

 <h4>Setting up additional GIS plugins</h4>
  By default only the Google Maps plugin is present.
  
  For setting up addional plugins see the
   <a href="file:///usr/local/share/sahana/mod/gis/">/usr/local/share/sahana/mod/gis/README</a>
  file.
