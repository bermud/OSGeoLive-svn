<h2>About</h2>
<p>
  <a href="http://www.sahanafoundation.org">Sahana</a> is a Free and Open
	Source Disaster Management system. It is a web based collaboration
	tool that addresses the common coordination problems during a
	disaster from finding missing people, managing aid, managing
	volunteers, tracking camps effectively between Government groups,
	the civil society (NGOs) and the victims themselves.

<h2>Running</h2>

 <h4>Installation</h4>
  When you first start Sahana you'll be taken to a web setup page.
  Most of this has been done for you, so on the first page you can
  just click "Next >" at the bottom, and on the second setup page 
  in the "Create new database" box you should keep the "Database User"
  as 'root' and  fill in 'user' for the password in the line directly
  below it. Then click on "Setup Database >" at the very bottom of the
  page without changing anything else.
  <p>
  On the third setup page you'll be asked to set up some passwords, and
  it insists on strong ones, e.g. "demo4osgeo" for all of them. Also
  on this page you for the purposes of the demo should leave Access Control
  set as "Disabled". Finish by clicking the "Write Configuration File >" button
  at the bottom of the page. This will give you a security warning (only important
  if you intend to install from the live demo DVD), and a button to "Start
  Sahana" which you will want to click.

 <h4>Usage</h4>
<!--
  This section is somewhat TODO.
 -->

  An easy way to get started is by adding a detail artifact. From the main
  menu on the left click on Situation Mapping, "Add Situation Markers", and
  add some information about a sample detail. You'll then be able to view
  and select this with the "Situation Map" link in the upper left corner
  of the page.

 <h4>Development</h4>
  Sahana is in active development and the spatial data tools are greatly
  improved in the yet-unreleased ("trunk") version. This includes support for:
  <ul>
    <li>GPS Interface module (waypoint and route upload/download via GpsBabel)
    <li>UMN Mapserver module (web admin front-end)
    <li>Extensive GIS configuration section in the Sahaha Administration
      module including support for external data sources from Google Maps,
      TMS, OpenStreetMap, KML OSM and GML geodata files, MS Virtual Earth,
      Yahoo Maps, WMS, GeoRSS, and Multimap.
  </ul>
  The stable version used on this live disc only includes support for Google
  Maps. You can explore the new features in the "trunk" working demo linked
  below.
