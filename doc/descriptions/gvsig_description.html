<h1>gvSIG 1.9</h1>
<h2>About</h2>
<p>
  <a href="http://gvsig.org">gvSIG</a> is a Geographic Information 
  System (GIS), that is, a desktop application designed for capturing, 
  storing, handling, analyzing and deploying any kind of referenced 
  geographic information in order to solve complex management and
  planning problems. gvSIG is known for having a user-friendly
  interface, being able to access the most common formats, both vector
  and raster ones. It features a wide range of tools for working with
  geographic-like information (query tools, layout creation, 
  geoprocessing, networks, etc.), which turns gvSIG into the ideal tool
  for users working in the land realm.
</p>

<h2>Running</h2>
	<p>
		To run gvSIG on the Live DVD, click on the gvSIG icon
		on the desktop.
	</p>
	
	<h3>Loading geodata</h3>
	<p>
		gvSIG can load lots of local data (raster and vector formats)
		as well as any OGC service (WxS) and other propietary formats
		like ArcIMS or Oracle databases. Open gvSIG, create a view, set
		up your working projection (view properties) and start adding
		geodata with the <em>View->Add layer</em> dialog.
	</p>
	
	<p>
		You can load several shapefiles and images from 
		<tt>/usr/local/share/openjump-data</tt> or
		<tt>/usr/local/share/qgis-data</tt> as well as any other
		sample data loaded or OGC service configured on the disc.
	</p>
	
	
  	<h3>Example Projects</h3>
 	<p>
		There is a sample project at 
		<tt>/home/user/gvSIG/sample-project.gvp</tt> folder. You can
		load it with gvSIG and see some sample styled data
		as well as a sample map.
	</p>


	
<h2>Getting Started</h2>

	You can look for help at user documentation on
	<a href="file:///usr/local/share/gvsig/gvSIG-1_1-man-v1-en.pdf">
	gvSIG English Manual</a> (PDF). Note that this manual refers to
	1.1.2 version as gvSIG doesn't have at this time a published
	manual of new features in English. Visit the gvSIG community website at 
	<a href="http://gvsig.org">http://gvsig.org</a> for more updated
