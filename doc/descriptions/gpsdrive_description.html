<h2>About</h2>
<p>
  <a href="http://www.gpsdrive.de">GpsDrive</a>
 is a car (bike, ship, plane, foot) navigation system.
 GpsDrive displays your position provided from a GPS on a zoomable map,
 the map file is autoselected depending on your position and preferred
 map scale.  All GPS receivers which support the NMEA protocol should
 be usable, as well as many USB GPSs using a binary protocol known to
 the <a href="http://gpsd.berlios.de">Gpsd</a> daemon.</p>

<h2>Running</h2>
 <p>You will most likely want to install the <tt>gpsd</tt> package so that
 you can talk to your GPS; without that GpsDrive is just a nice map viewer.

 <p>Speech output is supported if the "espeak" software is installed.
 To use live-maps from the OpenStreetMap project you need to install the
 openstreetmap-* packages as well. Static map tiles may be downloaded
 from the internet without any extra installation.

 <h3>Setting up your GPS</h3>
 <p>If you have a GPS connected you will want to start the gpsd service.
  To do that run:

<pre>
  sudo dpkg-reconfigure gpsd
</pre>

and

<pre>
  sudo /etc/init.d/gpsd start
</pre>

BlueTooth GPS users should take special care to read up about the no-probe
option. (for this reason we have not started gpsd automatically)

<BR><BR>
&bull; 'xgps' is a good program to check that Gpsd can see your GPS ok.

<h3>Using without a GPS as a mapbook</h3>
<p>If you don't have a GPS connected you can turn on Explore Mode
with the 'e' key and then use the arrow keys to move around.
<br>


<h3>Quick help</h3>
For help type '<tt>man gpsdrive</tt>' and '<tt>gpsdrive --help</tt>' at a Terminal prompt.

<h3>Customizing the display</h3>
Besides the options given in the Preferences menu and the different 
car/PDA/desktop modes offered from the command line, you can change the
displayed dashboard meters. Just click on one of the three dashboard
postions and select a new item. You can toggle on and off the dashboard
and map controls with the '<tt>d</tt>' and '<tt>m</tt>' keys.


<h3>Downloading maps</h3>
 Use the <tt>Options &rarr; Maps &rarr; Download</tt> tool to preview
and download new map tiles. Currently the OpenStreetMap web-tiles and
NASA OnEarth WMS servers are available as sources. There are a few command
line programs which come with GpsDrive which will let you bulk-download
a set of tiles covering your local area.


<h3>Mapnik rendering of OpenStreetMap data</h3>
If you have a local PostGIS database running (for example the one that comes
with the pgRouting software on this Live DVD) you can setup GpsDrive to
render very pretty street maps on the fly from OpenStreetMap.org data
using the Mapnik rendered. The PostgreSQL database it looks for by default
should be named "gis". Bonus points go to PostGIS experts who manage to
bend the pgRouting data thus enabling this option. (hint: comment out the
world boundary shapefile references in the ~/.gpsdrive/osm.xml file)


<h3>Keeping tabs on your friends</h3>
In the Preferences menu you can turn on the Friendsd service. This
transmits your position to a central server and lets your friends know
where you are. It comes with a program to run a private server if you
don't want the whole world seeing where you are. To enable this service
go into the Preferences menu and select the Friends tab. Type in a name
for yourself and click on the [Lookup] button to get the IP address of
the default friendsd server. Finally tick the Enable friends service box
and press [Close]. Icons showing where your friends are and where they are
headed will be shown at scales less than 1:10 million. There seem to be
a lot of friendly types in Europe.


<h3>Verbal instructions</h3>
GpsDrive can give you verbal warnings when you are nearing your
destination, etc. To try this out you must start the eSpeak software
which has been disabled by default on this Live-Disc to save memory.
To switch it on you will have to edit (as root) the
<tt>/etc/default/speech-dispatcher</tt> file and set <tt>RUN_SPEECHD=yes</tt>.
Then launch the service with
"<tt>sudo&nbsp;/etc/init.d/speech-dispatcher&nbsp;start</tt>".
GpsDrive will automatically find it at run time if it is switched on.
