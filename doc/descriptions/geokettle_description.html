<h1>GeoKettle</h1>
<h2>About</h2>
<p>
  <a href="http://www.geokettle.org">GeoKettle</a> is a powerful, metadata-driven spatial ETL
 (Extract, Transform and Load) tool dedicated to the integration of different data sources
 for building and updating geospatial databases and data warehouses. It is based on
 <a href="http://kettle.pentaho.org">Pentaho Data Integration (Kettle)</a> and like Kettle,
 GeoKettle is released under the GNU Lesser General Public License (LGPL) license.

<h2>Running</h2>
  <p>To run GeoKettle on the Live DVD, click on the GeoKettle link on the desktop.
  This will launch Spoon, the main user interface for designing ETL transformations
  and jobs. On the welcome screen, click the "No repository" button. You can then
  create your own transformations and jobs, or browse the examples present in
  the /opt/geokettle/samples/ directory. Hint: look at the transformations/geokettle/
  subdirectory for a demonstration of geospatial features specific to GeoKettle. The files
  in other subdirectories are non-geospatial transformations, which are also included in the
  regular version of Pentaho Data Integration (Kettle).
