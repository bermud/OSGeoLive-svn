<h2>About</h2>
<p>
  The <a href="http://www.ushahidi.com">Ushahidi</a> Engine is a platform
  that allows anyone to gather distributed data via SMS, email or web and
  visualize it on a map or timeline. Our goal is to create the simplest
  way of aggregating information from the public for use in crisis response.

<h2>Running</h2>
 Starting Ushahidi via the desktop icon or menu item opens the web browser
 and brings you to the Installation page. A Ushahidi site is pretty easy
 to set up:
 <p>
 Choose "Basic Installation", "Let's get started", and it will
 prompt you for a few details. The database name is "ushahidi", database
 user name is "user", the password is also "user". The database host is 
 "localhost". Then continue. In the <i>General</i> setup page choose a 
 site name (title) for your website such as "OSGeo demo" and if you like
 tag-line subheading as well. The email address it asks you for is
 used for recieving automatic submissions which it will process and add
 to the database and maps, and send automated reports from. For now set
 it to something like "ushahidi@localhost.localdomain" or
 "ushahidi@example.org" and 'Continue'.
 <p>
 After that is all done it should tell you that installation was successful
 and give you a link to 'View your website'. From now on when you start from
 the menu or desktop icon it will lead you right to this page.
 <p>
 The setup up README page is available locally in the
  <a href="file:///var/www/ushahidi/readme.html">/var/www/ushahidi/readme.html</a>
 file.
