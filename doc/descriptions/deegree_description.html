<h1>deegree</h1>
<h2>What is deegree?</h2>
<p><a href="http://deegree.org">deegree</a> is a comprehensive Java-based 
framework published under an open source license (LGPL). It is based on 
the idea of integrating spatial standards as provided by the ISO/TC211 
(19xxx series of standards) and the Open Geospatial Consortium (OGC). 
Members of the deegree community are heavily involved in the open 
standardization process and contribute to specifications like WFS, SLD, 
WMS, WPS and others. deegree targets two major user groups: end users and 
software developers</p>

<h2>deegree for end users</h2>
<p>The end user usually runs a deegree based spatial server component for
sharing spatial data through standardized interfaces (e.g. Web Feature
Services, Web Coverage Services, Sensor Observation Services, etc.).
Those can easily be integrated with file based spatial data from ESRI
shape files, GML data sources and various database backends
(PostgreSQL/PostGIS, Oracle, MS SQL Server, etc.). To visualize those
data, deegree provides web-based portal components (iGeoPortal) with 
sophisticated user management interfaces, service monitoring and metadata 
facilities. It realizes the idea of a web based GIS in a user-friendly yet 
powerful way.</p>

<h2>deegree for software developers</h2>
<p>For software developers, deegree provides a comprehensive geospatial
library for spatial data processing, service setup and all kinds of
spatial data handling. An easy-to-use and well documented Application
Programming Interface (API) allows customization of services,
integration of new data sources, processing of data and time series, and
much more. It has been widely used for research- and development-projects
worldwide and is backed by a huge and active user community. The deegree
project maintains mailing lists for software developers and users, is
discussed during an annual user-conference and provides facilities to
share ideas and documentation through a publicly accessible wiki.</p>
    
<h2>Running deegree</h2>
<p>To run deegree on the LiveDVD, click on the desktop icon "start deegree". 
Wait a few seconds and a browser will pop up pointing to the deegree welcome 
page (http://localhost:8081/), from where you can access the main deegree 
services and the client application as well as the relevant documentation.</p>
<p>To stop deegree, please use the desktop icon "stop deegree". This will only 
shut down the applications (WMS, WFS, WCS, iGeoPortal). It will not close the 
firefox tab. If you want to use the deegree applications in firefox again, 
please hit "start deegree". Please allow some seconds for the application to load.</p>
