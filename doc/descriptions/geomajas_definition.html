	<p><a href="http://www.geomajas.org/">Geomajas</a> is a free and open source GIS framework which seamlessly integrates powerful server side algorithms into the web browser.
	</p>
	<p>The focus of Geomajas is to provide a platform for <b>server-side integration</b> of geospatial data (be it through GeoTools or Hibernate), allowing multiple users to control and manage the data from within their own browsers. In essence, Geomajas provides a set of powerful building blocks, from which the most advanced GIS application can easily be built.
	</p>
	<p>What makes Geomajas unique is its strong server side focus. The processing, styling, filtering, caching, etc. of geospatial data always happens within a secured context. All this makes Geomajas applications incredibly scalable and performing, keeping the client a <b>real thin client</b>.
