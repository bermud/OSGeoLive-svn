    Marble is meant to be a generic geographical map widget. It shows the
    earth as a sphere but doesn't make use of any hardware acceleration
    (NO OpenGL). So although it might look similar to professional
    applications like Google Earth or NASA World Wind it's rather meant to
    be a small light weight multi purpose widget for KDE.
