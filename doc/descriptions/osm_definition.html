    <p>
    <a href="http://www.openstreetmap.org">OpenStreetMap</a> is a project aimed
    squarely at creating and providing free geographic data such as street
    maps to anyone who wants them. The project was started because most maps
    you think of as free actually have legal or technical restrictions on their
    use, holding back people from using them in creative, productive or
    unexpected ways.
    The JOSM editor and Gosmore viewer / wayfinder / search client are included.
