<p>
  <a href="http://www.ossim.org">OSSIM</a> (Open Source Software Image Map)
  OSSIM is a high performance software system for remote sensing,
  image processing , geographical information systems and photogrammetry.
  It is an open source software project maintained at www.ossim.org and
  has been under active development since 1996. The lead developers for
  the project have years of experience in commercial and government remote
  sensing systems and applications. OSSIM has been funded by several US
  government agencies in the intelligence and defense community and the
  technology is currently deployed in research and operational sites.
  The name OSSIM is a contrived acronym (Open Source Software Image Map)
  that is pronounced "awesome" -- the acronym was established by our first
  government customer.</p>
