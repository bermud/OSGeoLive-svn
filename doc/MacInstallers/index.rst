TO INSTALL:
~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~

Install the base packages (Frameworks) first, followed by the support
packages, and finally the end-user programs. The base packages must be
installed in order.

Not all Frameworks and support packages are needed for all end user
programs. Consult the above website for details.

The framework packaging method is a bit more trouble up front, but
ensures the minimum amount of disk space is used by programs which
share common support libraries, and that these components can be safely
upgraded in future without rendering the other programs unusable.


Happy Mapping!
