Web Processing Service (WPS)
============================

.. Writing Tip:
  1 paragraph or 2 defining what the standard is.

The WPS standard provides rules for standardizing inputs and outputs (requests and responses) for geospatial processing services, such as polygon overlays and their inputs and outputs.

  :alt: WPS in Context

The OGC® Web Processing Service (WPS) Interface Standard (http://www.opengeospatial.org/standards/wps) is a processing service. The standard defines an interface that facilitates the publishing of geospatial processes and clients’ discovery of and binding to those processes. Processes include any algorithm, calculation or model that operates on spatially referenced vector or raster data. A WPS may offer calculations as simple as subtracting one set of spatially referenced numbers from another (e.g., determining the difference in influenza cases between two different seasons), or as complicated as a global climate change model.
