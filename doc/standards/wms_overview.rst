Web Map Service (WMS)
=====================

.. Writing Tip:
  1 paragraph or 2 defining what the standard is.

The (OGC®) Web Map Service Interface Standard (WMS) provides a simple HTTP interface for requesting geo-registered map images from one or more distributed geospatial databases. The response to the request is one or more map images (returned as JPEG, PNG, etc) that can be displayed a browser and desktop applications. (http://www.opengeospatial.org/standards/wms)

  :alt: WMS in Context

The WMS standard defines three operations: 

* GetCapabilities (required): Obtain service-level metadata, which is a machine-readable (and human-readable) description of the WMS's information content and acceptable request parameters. 

* GetMap (required): Obtain a map image whose geospatial and dimensional parameters are well defined. 

* GetFeatureInfo (optional): Ask for information about particular features shown on a map. 

This standard is now implemented in hundreds of products, many of which are registered at (http://www.opengeospatial.org/resource/products/compliant).

An excellent example of a portal that uses WMS is NC OneMap (http://www.nconemap.com/): “NC OneMap relies on Web Map Services (WMS) to bring data together from multiple hosts. NC OneMap partners establish a WMS from their servers. This OGC standard allows data to be created and stored in numerous proprietary software configurations (ESRI, MapInfo, Intergraph, etc), but is viewable by all.”
