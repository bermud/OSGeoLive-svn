<h1>Welcome to the Arramagong Live DVD</h1>
<div class="contents">
<hr>
<p>
<a href="http://arramagong.com/">Arramagong</a> is a
    self-contained live DVD, based on
     <a href="http://www.gisvm.com/">GISVM</a> for
     <a href="http://www.xubuntu.org/">XUbuntu 9.04</a>,
    that allows you to try a wide
    variety of open source geospatial software without installing anything.
    This DVD is composed entirely of free software, allowing it to be freely
    distributed, duplicated and passed around without concern for licensing
    issues.</p>
<p>
    This live DVD provides effective tools for a range of geospatial use
    cases, including storage, publishing, viewing, analysis and manipulation
    of data. It also contains sample datasets and standard software products,
    including Apache Web Server, Apache Tomcat Application Server, Sun Java,
    PostgreSQL and PGAdmin.</p>
<p>
    You can use the DVD without the need to install anything. Simply
    reboot your machine with the DVD in the tray. During the boot process you
    will first be asked to choose your preferred language. In the boot menu
    that appears after the language selection choose "Try Arramagong without
    any change to your computer". The DVD will then start Linux and you will
    be able to trial all the applications and services directly from the
    DVD.</p>
<p>Most of the Live DVD applications can be installed on Apple OSX and
    Microsoft Windows as well. <a href="http://arramagong.com/">Arramagong</a>
    comes with Macintosh Leopard/Snow Leopard and Windows XP/Vista
    installers for these applications in the <a href="./win/">win</a> and
    <a href="./mac/">mac</a> folders of the DVD.</p>
