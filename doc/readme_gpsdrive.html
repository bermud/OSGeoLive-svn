&bull; If you have a GPS connected you will want to start the gpsd service.
To do that run:

<pre>
  sudo dpkg-reconfigure gpsd
</pre>

and

<pre>
  sudo /etc/init.d/gpsd start
</pre>

BlueTooth GPS users should take special care to read up about the no-probe
option. (for this reason we have not started gpsd automatically)

'xgps' is a good program to check that it can see your GPS ok.

&bull; For help type 'man gpsdrive' at a Terminal prompt.
