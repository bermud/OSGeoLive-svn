GRASS GIS
=========

Fully featured GIS
~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~

The Geographic Resources Analysis Support System, commonly referred to as
GRASS, is a Geographic Information System (GIS) providing powerful raster,
vector, and geospatial processing engines in a single integrated software
suite. GRASS includes tools for spatial modeling, visualization of raster
and vector data, management and analysis of geospatial data, and the
processing of satellite and aerial imagery. It also provides the capability
to produce sophisticated presentation graphics and hardcopy maps. GRASS has
now been translated into twenty languages and supports a huge array of data
formats.

GRASS is currently used around the world in academic and commercial settings
as well as by many governmental agencies and environmental consulting
companies. It runs on a variety of popular hardware platforms and is Free
open-source software released under the terms of the GNU General Public License.

The GRASS software includes over 400 built-in analysis modules. Additionally,
over 100 community supplied modules and toolboxes are available for free
from the community wiki site. After 27 years of continuous
development GRASS is both the oldest and largest Open Source GIS available.
It is easily scriptable and versatile enough to be used both for batch data
processing on massively-parallel supercomputers as well as a handy desktop
GIS for handheld PDAs or netbooks.
