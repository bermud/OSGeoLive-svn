MapWindow GIS Lite
================================================================================

Desktop GIS
~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~

MapWindow GIS is a Windows based, Open Source GIS client where you can visualize, 
manage, edit, analyse data, and compose printable maps.
It includes powerful analytical functions through integration with GEOS and GDAL/OGR (v2).
MapWindow is easy to incorporate into MS-Office based products such as MS-Excel 
and MS-Access, as well as programs written in C++, C#, VB.NET and Delphi, 
as MapWindow is based upon an ActiveX control called MapWinGIS.
This version is MapWindow Open Source GIS Lite, based on MapWinGIS v4.9.3. 

The two biggest improvement of this version are probably the support for the GeoSpatial database 
PostGIS and the native Shapefile editor. Numerous bug fixes make this version of 
MapWinGIS the most stable and fastest ever.

The version included on this DVD is a Lite version because not all functionality 
of MapWindow Desktop v4.8.8 are included. For instance the toolbox and plug-ins 
are not included. This Lite version does has a fully functional shapefile editor 
and support for PostGIS. 

MapWindow v5 (first version due mid 2015) will have 
the toolbox and plug-in architecture again. 

.. note:: MapWindow requires installation on a Microsoft Windows system before it can be run. 
Installation files are included on the full ISO version of `OSGeo-Live <http://live.osgeo.org>`_ or may be 
downloaded from http://mapwindow4.codeplex.com/releases.
