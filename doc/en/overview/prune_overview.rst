Prune
=====

GPS Track-Editing Software 
~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~

`Prune <http://activityworkshop.net/software/prune/>`_ is a tool for viewing,
editing and converting coordinate data from GPS systems.  It uses OpenStreetMap
imagery to show recorded tracks and waypoints, and provides a variety of tools
to let you edit, crop and prune the data points.  It also has functions for
correlating photos to the coordinates using the photo timestamps.

Prune uses Gpsbabel, if available, to read data directly from a GPS receiver,
and can send the edited data back to the receiver too.

Prune runs on Mac OSX, Windows and Linux, and is available
in over ten different languages.
