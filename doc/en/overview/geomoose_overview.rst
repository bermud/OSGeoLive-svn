GeoMoose
========

.. Cameron comment: Target audience are GIS users, not programmers. So we don't mention programming languages like "Javascript". Maybe title should be "Browser GIS Portal".

Web Client Javascript Framework
~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~

.. Cameron comment: From a user's perspective, why would you pick GeoMoose over something like GeoMajas, OpenLayers, MapBender. Is it easy to customise? Is it fast? I suggest following the style of Browser Clients here: http://live.osgeo.org/en/overview/overview.html

GeoMOOSE is a Web Client Javascript Framework for displaying distributed cartographic data. GeoMOOSE has a number of strengths including modularity, configurability, and delivers a number of core functionalities in its packages. GeoMOOSE is also very light weight for servers making it easy to handle a large number of users, with a large number of layers, and a large number of services without stressing a server.

The GeoMOOSE core is written using JavaScript and HTML. It is entirely possible to run GeoMOOSE with nothing more than a basic webserver (Nginx, Apache, IIS). But besides the basic client core, GeoMOOSE also comes prepackaged with a number of built in services written in PHP. These services add the ability to perform drill-down identify operations, selection operations, and search datasets. If you have existing scripts that perform similar functions, GeoMOOSE can be tuned to work with those services, no matter which language they were written in.
Being an open source project GeoMOOSE is also built upon other open source projects like MapServer and OpenLayers.

.. Cameron comment: This section needs to be filled in. I assume GeoMoose is at least a WMS and WFS client? Is it a WMS server too? If so, mention it.
