OTB
=====

Image Processing
~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~

ORFEO Toolbox library (OTB) is a high performance image processing library. It is primarily used for processing remote sensing images such as those gathered by radars, satellites and aerial photography. OTB provides tools for optic and radar images (tridimensional aspects, changes detection, texture analyis, pattern matching, optic/radar complementarities).

OTB has been funded the French Space Agency (CNES) in the frame of the
Methodological Part of the ORFEO Accompaniement Program. It has been
actively developed since 2006. OTB is based on the established medical image processing library ITK and is distributed as open source.
