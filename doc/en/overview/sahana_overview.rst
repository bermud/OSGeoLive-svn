Sahana Agasti
=============

Disaster management web service
~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~

Sahana is a Free and Open Source Disaster Management system. It is
a web based collaboration tool that addresses the common coordination
problems during a disaster from finding missing people, managing aid,
managing volunteers, tracking camps effectively between Government
groups, the civil society (NGOs) and the victims themselves.

The Sahana project was initiated by volunteers in the Sri Lankan FOSS
development community to help their fellow countrymen and
countrywomen affected during the 2004 Asian Tsunami in December 2004.
The system was officially used by the Government of Sri Lanka and the
system was released as Free and Open Source software. Subsequently a
re-write as a generic disaster management tools was incubated with
the sponsorship of the Swedish International Development Agency, IBM, the US National Science Foundation and it has been used by
dozens of Governments and NGOs since then.
