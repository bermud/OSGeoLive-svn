.. Comment: This image is too big for an icon. It should ideally be 125x125
  pixels. Note this icon is included into diagrams in powerpoint presentations
  which requires a constant and size for the image. (Otherwise the image is
  compressed to be very small and thin)

.. Comment:
  Is the following bullet point correct?
.. End Comment
* Upload, search, filter, view and download EO data.
* Web based and command line administration interface.
* Registration of existing raster data archives.
* Publish data via Web Coverage Service (WCS) standard:

.. Comment: You mention "core WCS support". Do you cover all the WCS queries? 
  What is not supported?
  Am I right in implying that you cover all WCS 2.0 functionality, as well
  as some extra queries not in the standard yet?
.. End Comment

  * WCS 1.0, 1.1 and 2.0 support
 
.. Comment: If you cover all WCS 2.0, then no need to list each interface.
    including: GetCapabilities, DescribeCoverage, and GetCoverage requests.
.. End Comment

  * Proposed extensions to WCS including: GeoTIFF 
    encoding, predefined projections (CRSs), scaling & interpolation, and 
    non-referenced access.
  * Protocols supported are KVP, XML/POST (used together with SOAP2POST
    Proxy to provide an XML/SOAP interface).

* Publish using the following formats:

  * GML AP â€“ Coverages for RectifiedGridCoverages.
  * 2-D EO Coverages derived from gmlcov:RectifiedGridCoverage.
  * 2-D EO Coverages derived from gmlcov:ReferenceableGridCoverage.
  * Dataset Series as a collection of EO Coverages e.g. in a time series.
  * DescribeEOCoverageSet operation on Dataset Series and EO Coverages.
  * Stitched Mosaic of Rectified EO Coverages including contributingFootprint.
  * EO Metadata.

* Coverage formats supported:

 * GeoTIFF.
 * Formats supported by the GDAL library.

* Publishing of images through WMS and EO-WMS standard
