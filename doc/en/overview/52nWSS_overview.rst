52Â°North WSS
============

About
~~~~~

The 52North Web Security Service (WSS) lets you easily restrict access to spatial services and
their resources using role-based permissions.

.. Cameron comment: Please include an image, maybe a screen grab of a configuration page, or even a stock photo of a lock if you haven't got a good screen grab. Make sure you have the rights to release image as Creative Commons.

With 52North WSS you can define access policies like:

  *All users in role 'external' are allowed to access just layers A and B of the WMS with GetMap.*

or

  *GetFeatureInfo is only allowed on layer A in a specific area defined by a bounding box.*

The 52North WSS is a Java Web Application which usually runs in a Apache Tomcat Servlet container.
It acts as a proxy for an arbitrary number of OGC Web Services, receiving all requests and acting 
upon the defined policies. Thus, existing service implementations don't need to be changed.

.. Cameron comment: I suggest adding a sentence here, or in Features, noting how a user would create an access policy. Is there a web GUI and pull down lists? Or does a user create an XML file?
