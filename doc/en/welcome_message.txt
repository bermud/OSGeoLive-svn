Welcome to the OSGeo Live GIS DVD.


See the road-sign Help icon on the Desktop for information about the        
Live disc and virtual-machine, including a synopsis of bundled
geospatial packages and a series of quick-start short tutorials.

To change the language, log out (Applications menu) and along the
bottom of the login window is a language drop-down menu. Once you log
back in (the username and password are both "user"), there is a flag
icon on the top menu bar that lets you pick the keyboard layout. You
can also set it via the menus with Applications > Settings > Language
Support.

If you have the full DVD edition, various program installers for
Macintosh and Microsoft Windows can be found in the MacInstallers
and WindowsInstallers directories; see the main help page.

Passwords for various things can be found in the passwords.txt file on
the Desktop.

If you need to become "root" (the UNIX super-user) open a Terminal
and type "sudo su", then enter "user" as the password if you are
asked.

Happy mapping!
