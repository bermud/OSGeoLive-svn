Welcome to the OSGeo Live GIS DVD.


See the road-sign Help icon on the Desktop for information about the        
Live disc and virtual-machine, including a synopsis of bundled
geospatial packages and a series of quick-start short tutorials.

To change the language, log out (Applications menu) and along the
bottom of the login screen is the language menu. Once you log back in
(the password if you need it is "user"), there is a flag icon on the
top menu bar that lets you pick the keyboard layout. You can also set
it via the menus with Applications > Settings > Language Support.

If you have the full DVD edition, various program installers for
Macintosh and Microsoft Windows can be found in the MacInstallers
and WindowsInstallers directories.

Passwords for various things can be found in the passwords.txt file on
the Desktop.

If you need to become "root" (the UNIX super-user) open a Terminal
and type "sudo su", then enter "user" as the password.

Happy mapping!
