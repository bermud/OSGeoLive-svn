Sahana Quickstart 
*****************

Getting Started
===============

Sahana Eden is already installed and configured when you start OSGeo-Live. To access Sahana Eden, `click here <http://127.0.0.1:8000/eden>`_, or click on the Geospatial menu, then Crisis Management, then Sahana Eden. By default, you will have view-only rights to access the data. If you wish to create new records, or edit existing records, you will need to be logged in as a user - use the following credentials to get started.

* Username: admin
* Password: admin

If you have entered example crowd-sourced data in Ushahidi, then you can access that information in Sahana Eden by `following this link <http://127.0.0.1:8000/eden/irs/ireport/ushahidi>`_. 

You will find it has already been configured to access the map data and map servers that are part of OSGeo-Live. Sahana Eden can utilise OpenStreetMap as an underlying map layer in the `map viewing client <http://127.0.0.1:8000/eden/gis/map_viewing_client>`_. Sahana Eden supports a wide range of OpenStreetMap services.
