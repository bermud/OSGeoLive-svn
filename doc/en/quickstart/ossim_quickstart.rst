********************************************************************************
Ossim Quickstart 
********************************************************************************

Open Source Software Image Map (OOSIM) is a high performance engine for remote sensing,
image processing, geographical information system (GIS) and photogrammetry.

This Quick Start describes how to:

  * View raster images with Imagelinker
  * Run ossimPlanet

Imagelinker
================================================================================

* Start Imagelinker from its icon from the "Spatial Tools" folder on
  the desktop 

* Open an image file, using :menuselection:`File --> Open Image --> /home/user/data/raster/cape_cod/p011r031_7t19990918_z19_nn10.tif`

* Repeat the previous operation for the files : `p011r031_7t19990918_z19_nn20.tif`
  and `p011r031_7t19990918_z19_nn30.tif`

* Another way to load all the images at once is to simply drag and drop
  them into the Imagelinker main window

* To tidy up the windows, maximize the main window, then in the top menu
  bar go to :menuselection:`Window --> Tile`

* You can keep all the satellite band views in sync by clicking :guilabel:`Fit` in
  one of the smaller windows, then :guilabel:`Propagate` in that same window.
  Try doing the same in the larger window.

* Again in the large image window make sure the zoom button (magnifying
  glass) is depressed and click in middle of the Cape (that's Wellfleet Harbor).
  Then click again for a closer view, and again click the :guilabel:`Propagate`
  button in the large image window to sync that view with the other band windows.
  In a similar way you can press the pan button (hand icon) and then click on
  the end of the Cape, and then the :guilabel:`Propagate` button to align the
  other windows. 

A more in depth tutorial covering merging bands into an RGB composite
is `available online`_.

OssimPlanet
================================================================================

* Launch OssimPlanet from its icon in the "Desktop GIS" folder on the
  desktop 

* Select :menuselection:`File --> Open Image --> /home/user/data/raster/cape_cod/cape_cod/p011r031_7t19990918_z19_nn10.tif`
  to load a LANDSAT image (or simply drag and drop the image into the main window).

* In the `Layer` tree panel on the left side, click on the small triangle to
  the left of *Image Layers* to expand it. Next double-click on ``p011r031_7t19990918_z19_nn10.tif``.
  You should now see the scene zoom to the image's location.

.. note::
   To turn off the daylight auto-shading, `un`-check
   :menuselection:`File --> Preferences --> Environment --> Enable Ephemeris`

* Experiment with navigating the scene using the mouse. Dragging the left
  mouse button pans; dragging the middle mouse button rolls; and dragging
  the right mouse button zooms in and out.

* If you get lost, double clicking on the Blue Marble image in the Layer
  tree will zoom back out to a view of the whole planet, resetting the view.


What Next?
================================================================================

* We have prepared a number of tutorials_ demonstrating more of
  Ossim's capabilities.
