52°North SOS Quickstart 
********************************************************************************

Getting Started
================================================================================

The 52°North SOS is a web service, that allows you to provide and collect spatial sensor data (including metadata and measurements/observations).

1) Go to :menuselection:`Geospatial --> Web Services --> 52North --> Start 52North SOS`	to start the 52°North SOS or use this `direct link <http://localhost:8080/52nSOS/>`_. (If the service is not reachable, try to start the Tomcat servlet engine following the steps at the bottom of this page.)

2) Firefox will open the 52°North SOS test client welcome page (see Fiq. 1). Please select the specification version you would like to use, 1.0.0 for example:

3) The test client appears. It can be used to send requests to the service using a simple form. A drop-drown list allows you to select from a collection of predefined requests, which are adopted to the respective service version selected in the step before.

4) To get started with the SOS, select the GetCapabilities_allSections.xml request from the drop-down list next to "Request Examples" (see number [1] in Fig. 2).
  
5) Push the **Send button** (number [2] in Fig. 2) and the request will be transmitted to the 52°North SOS. As result, a XML document is returned (see Fig. 3), which shows the capabilities of the SOS (service metadata such as keywords or provider, available operations and filters, contained observation data,...). To see the original response open the source view (Ctrl+U).

6) In Order to build your own requests you will need the `capabilities <http://localhost:8080/52nSOS/sos?REQUEST=GetCapabilities&SERVICE=SOS&ACCEPTVERSIONS=1.0.0>`_  of the 52°North SOS (specification 1.0.0). Using the information provided in the capabilities, and most importantly the contents section, you can adjust the provided requests in the test client. Just select a GetObservation request (GetObs...) from the drop down menu and use it as a template for requesting your own observation subsets.

* The 52°North Sensor Web mailing list: swe@52north.org, 
* Check the 52°North `Sensor Web community forum <http://sensorweb.forum.52north.org/>`_, 
* Check the 52°North `SOS Client <http://sensorweb.demo.52north.org/SOSclient/>`_,
* 52°North `SOS website <http://52north.org/communities/sensorweb/sos/>`_, or 
* The website of the `52°North Sensor Web Community <http://52north.org/communities/sensorweb/>`_.

* When the SOS is not available, please check if the tomcat servlet engine is running using the following command:

::

  user@osgeolive:~$ sudo /etc/init.d/tomcat6 status
  * Tomcat servlet engine is running with pid 1234          <-- Tomcat is running
  [...]
  * Tomcat servlet engine is not running.                   <-- Tomcat not runing, so please start:
  user@osgeolive:~$ sudo /etc/init.d/tomcat6 start
  * Starting Tomcat servlet engine tomcat6           [ OK ] <-- Tomcat is running, now
