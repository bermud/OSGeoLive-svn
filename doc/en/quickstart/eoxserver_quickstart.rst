 EOxServer Quickstart
================================================================================

Overview
--------

EOxServer is a server for presenting big Earth Observation (EO) data 
archives and metadata via Open Standards. It builds upon an Open Source 
stack of software which includes Python, :doc:`MapServer 
<../overview/mapserver_overview>`, Django/GeoDjango, :doc:`GDAL 
<../overview/gdal_overview>`, PROJ.4 and a :doc:`SpatiaLite 
<../overview/spatialite_overview>` or :doc:`PostGIS 
<../overview/postgis_overview>` database.

This Quick Start describes how to:

* View, filter, subset, and download EO data via EOxServer's Web Client
* Register EO data archives via EOxServer's Admin Client

See the :doc:`EOxServer Overview <../overview/eoxserver_overview>`, the 
`local EOxServer documentation 
<../../eoxserver-docs/EOxServer_documentation.pdf>`_, or the `online 
EOxServer documentation <http://eoxserver.org/doc/>`_ for more information.

Demonstration Instance
----------------------

In case you use OSGeoLive with 1GB RAM or less it is recommended to stop default Tomcat service before launching EOxServer
:: 

  sudo service tomcat6 stop

The icon labeled `EOxServer` filed under `Web Services` launches a browser 
showing the demonstration instance available at http://localhost/eoxserver/ 
which provides the same data as the `one available online 
<https://eoxserver.org/demo_stable/>`_.

The icon labeled `EOxServer Documentation` also filed under `Web Services` 
launches a pdf viewer showing the available documentation.

Web Client
~~~~~~~~~~

The **Web Client** link allows you to see a list of available `Dataset 
Series` and `Stitched Mosaics`. The demonstration has one `Dataset Series` 
configured named "MER FRS 1P RGB reduced" holding three ENVISAT MERIS 
scenes. Please refer to the `online demonstration documentation 
<http://eoxserver.org/doc/en/users/demonstration.html>`_ for more 
information on the available data.

Selecting a list entry provides you with a map view showing the outlines of 
the available `Datasets`.

Using the standard OpenLayers controls you can enable also previews of the 
available data.

With the **Date slider** the `Datasets` shown can be limited to the time 
interval of interest.

The **Download** button provides you a list of downloadable `Datasets`. 
Downloadable means within the set Bounding Box or currently viewn map extent 
if not set and the set time interval. You can select which `Datasets` to 
download in which size, projection, format, and band subset.

**Start Download** initiates the actual download which might result in 
multiple files if multiple `Datasets` have been selected.

Admin Client
~~~~~~~~~~~~

The **Admin Client** link brings you to the login page for the `Admin 
Client`. The password for the user `admin` is `admin`.

The `Admin Client` is Djangos standard admin and allows you to configure the 
available data. Please feel free to explore the client. More information can 
be found in the `operators' guide 
<http://eoxserver.org/doc/en/users/operators.html>`_.

It is for example possible to view and alter the `EO Metadata Entries` of the 
configured `Dataset Series`.

Log Viewer
~~~~~~~~~~

The **Log Viewer** link provides an easy way to view the latest log entries.

What Next?
----------

This is a simple demonstration, but you can do much more with EOxServer. The 
project website contains a lot of resources to help you get started. Hereâ€™s 
a few resources to check out next:

* Read the `EOxServer Operators' Guide 
  <http://eoxserver.org/doc/en/users/operators.html>`_.
* Read the complete `EOxServer Users' documentation 
  <http://eoxserver.org/doc/en/users/index.html>`_ starting from the `EOxServer 
  Basics <http://eoxserver.org/doc/en/users/basics.html>`_.
* Ready to use EOxServer? Then join the community on the `mailing lists 
  <http://eoxserver.org/doc/en/users/mailing_lists.html>`_ to exchange ideas, 
  discuss potential software improvements, and ask questions.
