deegree Quickstart 
******************

deegree is a Java framework which can be used for setting up web based spatial
data infrastructures. 

This Quick Start describes how to:

  * use the iGeoportal Client
  * send some example requests to our Services

Start deegree
=============

#. Choose deegree start from the start menu
#. The application will take a few moments to start up

Welcome View
============

#. When you start up deegree for the first time the Welcome view takes up the entire display. This screen
   has links to tutorials, documentation and the project website.

You can return to the Welcome view at any time by clicking on "`Start page`" in
the menu on the left side.

Services

the map window, there is a LayerListView, where different layers can be switched
on and off. To see activated layers, you have to refresh the map window with the
"`refresh`" button above the map. It is the leftmost one. A menu bar containing
tools for navigating in the map can be found above the map window. Click on the
magnifier with the "+" Button and click into the map window, to zoom in. You can
