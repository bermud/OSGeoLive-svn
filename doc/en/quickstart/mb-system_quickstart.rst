MB-System Quickstart 
********************************************************************************


Running
================================================================================

Users familiar
with :doc:`GMT <../overview/gmt_overview>` and :doc:`GDAL <../overview/gdal_overview>` will
be right at home with MB-System. In fact, MB-System makes heavy use of
GMT for its map rendering. MB-System is a modular, command line driven
suite of about 75 programs which work together to process massive (often
terabytes) worth of multi-beam swath bathymetry and sidescan sonar data
using automated scripts. Data files in dozens of data formats can be left
co-mingled and intact on the drive and only those needed will be
automatically selected, allowing for efficient processing and seamless mixing
of datasets collected at different times, by different ships, in different
data formats. Cartographic output and advanced 3D editing software is also
included.
