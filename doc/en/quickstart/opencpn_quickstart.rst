********************
OpenCPN Quickstart 
********************

Running
=======

Setting up your charts
~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~
Before running OpenCPN on the LiveDVD you should activate the sample data.
To do this open a Terminal from the main Applications menu and run
"`opencpn_noaa_agreement.sh`" at the command prompt. The user's
password is given in the file on the main desktop.

You can download additional US nautical charts from NOAA
at http://www.charts.noaa.gov


Setting up your GPS
~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~
If you have a GPS connected you will want to start the gpsd service.
To do that run:

::

  sudo dpkg-reconfigure gpsd

and

::

  sudo /etc/init.d/gpsd start

BlueTooth GPS users should take special care to read up about the no-probe
option. (for this reason we have not started gpsd automatically)


* '`xgps`' is a good program to check that Gpsd can see your GPS ok.
