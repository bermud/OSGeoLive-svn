GRASS GIS Quickstart 
********************

Running
=======

To run GRASS on the Live DVD, click on the GRASS link on the desktop.
From the "Welcome to GRASS" window select either the Spearfish or North
Carolina (nc_spm_08) dataset for the location, and "user1" for the mapset,
then click on [Start Grass].

This will launch GRASS with our brand new GUI written in wxPython. At
the time of writing we have gotten just about all of the kinks out of
it and are nearly ready to call it (and GRASS 6.4.0) complete. The old
Tcl/Tk GUI is still available if you prefer to use that; you can start
it by typing ``g.gui --ui`` on the command line.

If you are on a netbook with a very small display (800x600 resolution)
the startup screen might get a little scrunched and the [Start GRASS]
button hidden behind the location and mapset lists. If this happens to
you the solution is to drag the corner of the window to make it a little
bigger. You might have to move the window up past the top of the screen
a bit to get the room (hold down the Alt key and left-click drag the
window to move it).

Displaying maps
~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~

  :scale: 50 %
  :alt: screenshot
  :align: left

Once inside add a raster map layer such as "`elevation`" from the PERMANENT
mapset. To do this go into the GIS Layer Manager window and click on the
checkerboard toolbar button with a "+" on it. Then select the map name
you want from the "*map to be displayed*" pull-down list, and
click [Ok].

In a similar fashion add the "`roads`" vector layer from the PERMANENT
mapset by clicking on the toolbar button with a "+" and a bent poly-line
which looks a bit like a "V".

Over in the Map Display window toolbar click on the eyeball button to
render the view.

You should now see the maps displayed.

Plot an elevation profile
~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~

.. image:: ../../images/screenshots/800x600/grass-profile.png
  :scale: 50 %
  :alt: screenshot
  :align: right

Back in the GIS Layer Manager window click on the `elevation` raster
map name to select it. Then in the Map Display window, to the right of the
zooming buttons on the Map Display toolbar is an icon with a line graph
and checkerboard on it. Click on that and select **Profile Surface Map**.
If it isn't automatically listed again pick an elevation map as the raster
layer and press [Ok]. The second button in from the left allows you to
set out the profile line, click it then mark out a few points on the Map
Display canvas. When done go back to the Profile window and click on the
eyeball button to create the plot. Click on the I/O button of the far
right to close the profile window.

Create a random surface
~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~

Now let's create a new map. Select :menuselection:`Raster --> Generate 
surfaces --> Fractal surface` from the menu (near the bottom);
give your new map a name; adjust any options you like in the Options
tab (the defaults are fine); and click [Run]. You can then [Close] the
*r.surf.fractal* module's dialog window.

  :align: right

Adjust colors
~~~~~~~~~~~~~

Now add your new raster layer to the layer list as you did before with
the elevation raster map, except this time it will be in your "user1"
working mapset. You might un-tick the elevation layer check-box
now so that the two don't draw over the top of each other. Click on the
eyeball to view your new map.
The colors might not be as you'd like so let's change them. With the
fractal DEM selected in the layer list, in the
`Raster` menu select :menuselection:`Manage colors --> Color Tables`.
In the "Colors" tab click on the pull-down list for the "Type of color
table" option, and pick one from the list. "srtm" is a nice choice. Once
done click the [Run] button and close the *r.colors* dialog window.

Because you have altered the map's metadata, this time to re-render it
you will have to fully flush the display cache. So click on the little
refresh button next to the eyeball button to re-render all layers and you
should see your map with its new colors.
  
Create a shaded relief map
~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~

.. image:: ../../images/screenshots/800x600/grass-shadedrelief.png
  :scale: 50 %
  :alt: screenshot
  :align: right

Next we'll create a shaded relief map of the elevation layer we saw
earlier. Start by verifying that the computational region is set match
the raster map of interest, "`elevation`" in the PERMANENT mapset. To
do this, make sure it is loaded into the layer list of the main Layer
Manager window, right click on its name and select "Set computation region
from selected map(s)". In the `Raster` menu select :menuselection:`Terrain
analysis --> Shaded relief` (Terrain analysis is about half way
down), and the module control dialog will appear. With the elevation
map name selected as the input map click [Run]. Now add the new
elevation.shade @user1 map into your layer list and un-tick the other
raster layers, then click the eyeball to re-render. (If you get sick of
clicking the eyeball all the time you can tick the "Render" box in the
bottom right of the Map Display window to have that happen automatically)

Watersheds and streams
~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~

Once again select the `elevation` @PERMANENT map and in the `Raster` menu
choose :menuselection:`Hydrologic modeling --> Watershed analysis`. This
will open the ``r.watershed`` module. Set the `elevation` layer as your
input map, in the 'Input Options' tab set the sub-basin *threshold* to
10000 cells, then in the 'Output Options' tab enter "elev.basins" for the
watershed basin option and "elev.streams" for the stream segments option
just below it. Then click [Run].

Back in the Layer Manager window add those two new raster maps to the
layer list and make sure that they are the only two which are ticked
for display in the box to the left of the layer name. Right click on
the elev.basins raster map layer name and select "Change opacity level".
Set it to about 50% then re-render the Map Display.

  :scale: 50 %
  :alt: screenshot
  :align: left

In the GIS Layer Manager window click on the third button in from the
right to add a grid layer. For size of grid put 0:03 for 0 degrees and
3 minutes (format is D:M:S), then in the "Optional" tab tick Draw
geographic grid and press [Run] and re-render.

To add a scalebar go to the Map Display window and press the "Add
map elements" button to the right of where you selected the Profile tool
earlier and select "Add scalebar and north arrow". Read the instructions
then click [Ok]. A scalebar will appear in the top left. Drag it down
to the bottom left. From the same toolbar menu select "Add legend" and
in the instructions window click the Set Options button to set the
raster map name to create the legend for. After picking one click [Ok]
and [Ok] again. Drag your new legend over to the right side of the map
canvas.

Now you may be thinking to yourself that these fonts are a bit bare.
That's easily fixed in the GIS Layer Manager menus open :menuselection:`Config  --> 
Preferences` and in the Display tab click the [Set font] button and
then [Apply] in the Preferences window. You will have to do a full
re-render to see the change so click on the re-render button next to the
eyeball. The fonts will now be much prettier.

Vector modules
~~~~~~~~~~~~~~
 
The above tasks have only covered a few raster modules. Don't let this
give you the idea that GRASS is just for raster maps -- the vector engine
and modules are every bit as full-featured as the raster ones. GRASS
maintains a fully topological vector system which allows all sorts of
very powerful analyses.

3D visualization
~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~

.. image:: ../../images/screenshots/1024x768/grass-nviz.png
  :scale: 30 %
  :alt: screenshot
  :align: right

Start the 3D visualization suite from the :menuselection:`File --> NVIZ`
menu item. Select an `elevation` map as the raster elevation.
Once the 3D display interface loads, maximize the window.
Next select :menuselection:`Visualize --> Raster Surfaces` from the top menu,
and set the fine resolution to "1", then move the positioning puck and height
slider around to get different views.

To drape satellite or aerial imagery over the top of the DEM, in the
**Raster Surfaces** controls click on the **Surface Attributes**
drop down menu and select "color". Select "New Map" to pick the overlay
image. In the Spearfish dataset "`spot.image`" in PERMANENT is a
good choice; in the North Carolina dataset "`lsat7_2002_50`"
in PERMANENT is a good choice. Finally, click "Accept" and then once
back at the main window click on the "Draw" button in the top-left, just 
under the File menu.

Shutdown and the command line
~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~

When finished, exit the GRASS GUI with :menuselection:`File --> Exit`.
Before you close the GRASS terminal session as well, try a GRASS
module by typing "``g.manual --help``" which will give you a list
of module options. The GRASS command line is where the true power of
the GIS comes into its own. GRASS is designed to allow all commands
to be tied together in scripts for large bulk processing jobs. Popular
scripting languages are Bourne Shell and Python, and some neat tricks
for making scripting easier are included for both. With these tools
you can make a new GRASS module with only about 5 minutes of coding,
complete with powerful parser, GUI, and help page template.

"``g.manual -i``" will launch a web browser
with the module help pages. When done close the browser and type "exit"
at the GRASS terminal prompt to leave the GIS environment.
