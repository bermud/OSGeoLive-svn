OSGeo-Live Internationalisation Quickstart

Switching Language
--------------------------------------------------------------------------------

Many common languages are included on OSGeo-Live. To switch languages:

   #. Log out
   #. Select another language from the bottom panel menu.
   #. Select user="user", password="user"
   #. Repeat the process if wish to change languages again.

The system menus and many of the applications will now appear in the language chosen. If a specific program continues to display in English, then the program doesn't have a translation available - please consider volunteering to write a translation. Contact the program of interest directly for more information.

For additional languages see :menuselection:`Application --> System --> Language Support` (Requires an internet connection).

Keyboard Support
--------------------------------------------------------------------------------
International keyboard support is installed, but you will need to configure the system for your specific keyboard. 
To change settings open :menuselection:`Application --> Settings --> Settings Manager` in the menu and double-click on :guilabel:`Keyboard`
in the following dialog. Your password will be requested to allow configuration update, type "user" for the current user "user".

   #. Choose :guilabel:`Layout` tab in the Keyboard dialog
   #. Disable the option :guilabel:`Use system defaults`
   #. Click on button :guilabel:`Add` to add an additional layout
   #. Choose the preferred layout and
   #. Select it in the Keyboard dialog
   #. Go back to the main settings page (:guilabel:`Overview`)
   #. :guilabel:`Close` the Settings Dialog and log out to apply
