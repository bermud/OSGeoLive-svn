Switching Language
--------------------------------------------------------------------------------

We have installed many common languages. In order to switch the system you will need to:

   #. Log out
   #. On the user selection screen pick a user.
   #. In the bottom panel you will now see a menu to select a different language.
   #. Select another language and enter the password and continue the login as usual.
   #. Repeat the process if wish to change languages again.

The system menus and many of the applications will now appear in the language choosen. If a specific program continues to display in english there is no translation available currently, please consider volunteering to write a translation. Contact the program of interest directly for more information.

For additional languages see :menuselection:`Application --> System --> Language Support` (Requires an internet connection).

Keyboard Support

International keyboard support is installed, but you will need to configure the system for your specific keyboard. 
To change settings open :menuselection:`Application --> System --> Settings Manager` in the menu and double-click on :guilabel:`Keybord`
in the following dialog.

   #. Choose the prefered layout and
   #. Select it in the Keyboard dialog
