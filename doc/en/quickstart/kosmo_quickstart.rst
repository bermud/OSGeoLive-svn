Kosmo Desktop Quick Start 
********************************************************************************

Kosmo - Desktop is a user friendly, desktop GIS application which allows you to explore, edit 
and analyse spatial data from a variety of databases, vector and raster formats.

This Quick Start describes how to:

* start the application    
* load layers from files, databases and OGC services
* navigate through the map
* apply your styling to the loaded layers



Start Kosmo Desktop
================================================================================

In order to start the application, follow the next steps:

#. From the start menu, select *Other > Kosmo* (or from the desktop, go into *Desktop GIS* folder and double-click the Kosmo icon)

Kosmo Desktop main window
================================================================================

The Kosmo Desktop main window has the following sections:

  .. image:: ../../images/screenshots/1024x768/kosmo_main_window.jpg

* Main menus

* Main toolbar

* Layer tree

  Tree that contains the categories and layers that have been loaded in the current view.

* Map  

* Status bar

  Shows the application warning messages to the user.
  
* Current cursor coordinates       



Loading layers
================================================================================

Files
--------------------------------------------------------------------------------

To start out, we're going to load some of the sample data included on the LiveDVD:

#. Choose the option *View > Load Dataset...* or push the button with the green plus from the main toolbar

#. In the *Format* combobox, select *Shapefile* (**1**)

#. In the file chooser, select the file :file:`10m_admin_0_countries.shp` from the directory :file:`/usr/local/share/data/natural_earth` (**2**)

#. Press the *Ok* button to load the selected shapefile (**3**)

   .. image:: ../../images/screenshots/800x600/kosmo_select_shape_file.png

#. In the layer tree, press the visibility checkbox to make the layer visible

#. Choose again the option *View > Load Dataset...* or push the button with the green plus from the main toolbar

#. In the *Format* combobox, select *Image file* (**1**)

#. In the file chooser, select the file :file:`HYP_50M_SR_W.tif` from the directory :file:`/usr/local/share/data/natural_earth/HYP_50M_SR_W` (**2**)

#. Press the *Ok* button to load the selected image file (**3**)

   .. image:: ../../images/screenshots/800x600/kosmo_select_raster_file.png

#. In the layer tree, press the visibility checkbox to make the layer visible

#. You can see that the layer drawing order is from bottom to top in the layer tree: modify the layer order by dragging them in order to show them properly

   .. image:: ../../images/screenshots/1024x768/kosmo_load_file_example.jpg

.. note::
  The LiveDVD contains some file data examples in the following directories:
  
  * :file:`~/data` (a shortcut to :file:`/usr/local/share/data` or :file:`/home/user/data`)
  * :file:`/usr/local/share/openjump/data`
      
  You can try to load more examples from those directories. Remember to select the correct format from the *Format* combobox       

.. tip:: 
  It's possible to add all the images from a directory as an unique layer by selecting the parent directory in the *Load Dataset...* dialog: Kosmo Desktop will load them as a mosaic.


Databases
--------------------------------------------------------------------------------

We're going to load a database table as an example:

#. Choose the option *View > Load Dataset...* or push the button with the green plus from the main toolbar

#. In the *Format* combobox, select *Database* (**1**)

#. Fill the fields host, port, database name, user name and password with the values:

   * Host: localhost
     
   * Port: 5432
    
   * Database name: natural_earth
    
   * User name: user
    
   * Password: user        

#. Press the *Connect* button to load the tables present at the *natural_earth* database (**2**)

#. Select the checkbox corresponding to the table *10m_populated_places_simple* (**3**)

#. Press the *Ok* button to load the selected database table (**4**)

   .. image:: ../../images/screenshots/800x600/kosmo_database_connection.png
  
#. In the layer tree, press the visibility checkbox to make the layer visible

   .. image:: ../../images/screenshots/1024x768/kosmo_load_database_example.jpg


OGC services
--------------------------------------------------------------------------------

#. Start the GeoServer WMS included in the LiveDVD by selecting the option |osgeolive-appmenupath-geoserver| (or from the desktop, go into *Web Services* folder and double-click the Start Geoserver icon)

#. Press the *Load SDI Service* button at the main toolbar to open the wizard

#. In the *Select SDI service type* panel, select the option *WMS Service* (**1**) and press the *Next* button (**2**)

   .. image:: ../../images/screenshots/800x600/kosmo_wms_1.png

#. In the *Select Uniform Resource Locator (URL)*, type the URL http://localhost:8082/geoserver/ows?VERSION=1.1.1 (**1**) in the corresponding text field and press the *Connect* button (**2**)

#. If the connection is successful, press the *Next* button to go to the next panel (**3**)

   .. image:: ../../images/screenshots/800x600/kosmo_wms_3.png

#. Leave the default options loaded and press the *Finish* button (**1**) to start the layer loading

   .. image:: ../../images/screenshots/800x600/kosmo_wms_4.png

#. In the layer tree, press the visibility checkbox to make the layer visible

#. Select the layer in the layer tree and press the *Zoom To Layer* button to center the map in the WMS layer view

#. Reorder the layer tree by dragging the new layer and put it over the *HYP_50M_SR_W* raster layer

   .. image:: ../../images/screenshots/1024x768/kosmo_load_wms_results.jpg


.. note::
  Kosmo Desktop contains a list of WMS servers by default (most of them are from Spain). 
  If you're connected to internet, you can use them as described in the example with the local server.


Map navigation tools

.. note::
  If any tool/menu option is disabled, you can place the cursor over the button/option to see a tooltip where the reason is shown 



Styling
================================================================================

In this section we're going to style a layer by range using the country population as styling attribute:

#. Select the layer `10m_admin_0_countries` in the layer tree

#. Right click on it and select the option *Simbology > Change Styles...*

#. Click on the tab `Colour theming`

#. Activate the options *Enable colour theming* and *by range* (**1**)

#. Select `POP_CNTRY` as *Attribute* (**2**), 8 as *Range count* (**3**) and RYG (Color Brewer) as *Color schema* (**4**)

#. Press the *Ok* button to apply the changes (**5**)

   .. image:: ../../images/screenshots/800x600/kosmo_basic_style_classification.png

#. The layer will change its style to reflect the changes:

Things to Try
================================================================================

* Use the advanced style editor (`Symbology > Advanced style editor...`) to create more complex styles

* Use the `Query wizard` to select those features that accomplish a given criteria

* Activate the layer edition mode and use the available tools to edit it

* Generate a set of topology rules for a layer and try to edit it

* Activate the set of extensions that form part of the application and see the new tools that are present
