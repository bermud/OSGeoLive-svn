<h1>Welcome</h1>
<p>
<a href="http://live.osgeo.org">OSGeo-Live</a> is a
    self-contained live DVD, USB and Virtual Machine based on 
     <a href="http://www.xubuntu.org/">Xubuntu</a>,
    that allows you to try a wide
    variety of open source geospatial software without installing anything.
    It is composed entirely of free software, allowing it to be freely
    distributed, duplicated and passed around.</p>
<p>
    The live disc provides effective tools for a range of geospatial use
    cases, including storage, publishing, viewing, analysis and manipulation
    of data. It also contains sample datasets and standard software products,
    including Apache Web Server, Apache Tomcat Application Server, Sun Java,
    PostgreSQL and PGAdmin.</p>
<p>
    You can use this software without the need to install anything. Simply
    reboot your machine with the DVD in the tray, or from the USB, or run 
    in VMware Player or VirtualBox. In the boot menu
    selection choose "live", or wait for the automatic start.
    The DVD/Virtual Machine will then start Linux and you will
    be able to trial all the applications and services directly from the desktop.</p>

<h2>Virtual Machine Toolbox</h2>
<p>
	Many virtual machine managers (Like VMWare and VirtualBox) have
	additional tools that enable additional features when running guests. 
	These include, higher screen resolution support, copy and past
	between guest and host, support for graphics acceleration, and more.
	If you plan to run the live disc as a virtual machine you will likely
	want to install these additional tools, read below for instructions
	on how to do this for your particular virtual machine manager.
<br>
	These methods require an internet connection.
	Remember the password is: user
