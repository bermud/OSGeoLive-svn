<h1>Welcome</h1>
<p>
<a href="http://arramagong.com/">Arramagong</a> is a
    self-contained live DVD and Virtual Machine based on 
     <a href="http://www.xubuntu.org/">Xubuntu</a>,
    that allows you to try a wide
    variety of open source geospatial software without installing anything.
    It is composed entirely of free software, allowing it to be freely
    distributed, duplicated and passed around.</p>
<p>
    Arramagong provides effective tools for a range of geospatial use
    cases, including storage, publishing, viewing, analysis and manipulation
    of data. It also contains sample datasets and standard software products,
    including Apache Web Server, Apache Tomcat Application Server, Sun Java,
    PostgreSQL and PGAdmin.</p>
<p>
    You can use Arramagong without the need to install anything. Simply
    reboot your machine with the DVD in the tray, or run the Virtual Machine inside VMware Player or VirtualBox. In the boot menu
    selection choose "live", or wait 10 secs for the automatic select.
    The DVD/Virtual Machine will then start Linux and you will
    be able to trial all the applications and services directly from the desktop.</p>
<p>
    Application passwords are in the passwords.txt file on the desktop.

<p>Most of the Live DVD applications can be installed on Apple OSX and
    Microsoft Windows as well. The <a href="http://arramagong.com/">Arramagong</a> DVD also
    comes with Macintosh Leopard/Snow Leopard and Windows XP/Vista
