Geomajas
========

Geomajas is the extensible open source web mapping framework, enabling integrated GIS solutions for businesses and government. It has an integrated **client-server** architecture, with a high focus on **server-side integration** of your data (be it through GeoTools or Hibernate). This means that you apply your security and business logic on the server before anything gets send to the client, resulting in robust applications and a **real thin client**.

-----------

Geomajas is a free and open source GIS framework for building rich internet applications. It has sophisticated capabilities for displaying and managing geospatial information. Its modular design makes it easily extensible, while a client-server architecture guarantees endless scalability.

In essence, Geomajas provides a set of powerful building blocks, from which the most complex GIS applications can easily be built.

It's key features are:

* Integrated client-server architecture
* Geometry and attribute editing
* Custom attribute definitions
* Advanced querying capabilities (CQL)
* Out-of-the-box security
* Extensible plug-in mechanism
* Multiple front-end technologies
* Cross browser support, without the need for browser plug-ins
