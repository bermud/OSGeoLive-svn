Quantum GIS (QGIS) is a user friendly Open Source Geographic Information
System (GIS) licensed under the GNU General Public License. QGIS is an
official project of the Open Source Geospatial Foundation  (OSGeo). It
runs on Linux, Unix, Mac OSX, and Windows and supports numerous vector,
raster, and database formats and functionalities.

Quantum GIS provides a continously growing number of capabilities provided
by core functions and plugins. You can visualize, manage, edit, analyse
data, and compose printable maps. Get a first impression with some
screenshots and a more detailed feature list.

Quantum GIS is a volunteer driven project. We welcome contributions from
in the form of code contributions, bug fixes, bug reports, contributed
documentation, advocacy and supporting other users on our mailing lists
and the QGIS Forum. If you are interested in actively supporting the
project, you can find more information under the development menu and on
the QGIS Wiki. We also welcome financial contributions in the form of
sponsoring and funding.


.. Writing Tip:
  Provide a image of the application which will typically be a screen shot
  or a collage of screen shots.
  Store image in image/<application>_<name>.gif . Eg: udig_main_page.gif
  Screenshots should be captured from a 1024x768 display.
  Don't include the desktop background as this changes with each release
  and will become dated.
