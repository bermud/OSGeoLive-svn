Mapnik
======

Cartographic rendering engine
~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~

Mapnik is an OpenSource C++/Python toolkit for developing  mapping
applications. At the core is a C++ shared library providing
algorithms/patterns for spatial data access and visualization.

Essentially a collection of geographic objects (map, layer, datasource,
feature, geometry),  the library doesn't rely on "windowing systems" and
can be deployed in any server environment.  It is intended to play fair
in a multi-threaded environment and is aimed primarily,  but not
exclusively, at web-based development.

High-level Python bindings (boost.python) facilitate rapid application
development,  targeting zope3, django etc.

Mapnik is cross platform. Packages are available for most linux
distributions and installers are commonly used on Mac OS X and windows.
