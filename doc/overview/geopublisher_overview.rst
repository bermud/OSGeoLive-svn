About Geopublisher
~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~

`Geopublisher <http://en.geopublishing.org/Geopublisher>`_ is an atlas authoring system which allows easy publication of geo-data, documents, images, videos, and statistics in form of digital multimedia atlases. These atlases can be understood as minimal, pre-configured end-user GIS which offer selected functionality only where its meaningful.
Geopublisher provides tools for quality assurance and multilingual meta-data management. No in-depth knowledge of HTML, SLD or XML is required to create an atlas. Atlases can be directly published on CD, DVD, memory stick, external hard-drive or the Internet. The software is platform-independent.

Geopublishing.org software has some unique features which make it especially applicable in the fields of international research, participatory GIS, capacity building, and development cooperation. These features include:

* Atlases created with Geopublisher are simplified end-user GIS with selected functionality available only where it's meaningful.
* Hybrid online and offline atlases make geo-data accessible in areas beyond the digital divide.
* Multilingual management of meta-data avoids redundancies and allows for the quick release of updated atlases.
* Integrated WYSIWYG editors for SLD and HTML allow geopublishing without knowledge of SLD, XML or HTML.
* All software is Free and Open-Source Software compliant with OGC standards.
* Geopublisher + QuantumGIS + OpenOffice provide a free Open-Source Geopublishing desktop.
* AtlasStyle SLD editor is an integrated part of Geopublisher - so you do not need to install it extra.

Technical details:
------------------

* Platform independence: developed in Java, Geopublisher and its atlases run on Mac OS, Windows and Linux.
* Styling based on OGC SLD standard.
* Offline atlases run directly from any media - Java does not have to be installed.
* Supports tiled image pyramids for big raster data.
* Fully translated into German, English, Italian and Frensh. Turkish coming soon.
