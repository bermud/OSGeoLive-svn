SAGA GIS
========

System for Automated Geoscientific Analyses
~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~

SAGA GIS (System for Automated Geoscientific Analyses) is a free and open source geographic information system used for editing and analysing spatial data. It includes a large number of modules for the analysis of vector (point, line and polygon), table, grid and image data. Among others the package includes modules for geostatistics, image classification, projections, simulation of dynamic processes (hydrology, landscape development) and terrain analysis. The functionality can be accessed through a GUI, the command line or by using the C++ API.

SAGA GIS was developed since 2001, and the centre of SAGA development is located in the Institute of Geography at the University of Hamburg, with contributions from the growing world wide community.

SAGA comes with a comprehensive set of free modules, most of them published under the GPL (332 modules in 45 libraries).
