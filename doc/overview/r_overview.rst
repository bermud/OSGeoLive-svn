R Spatial Task View
===================

.. Writing Tip:
  Application Category Description:
  * Spatial Database
  * Web Service
  * Metadata Web Service
  * Desktop GIS
  * Browser GIS client
  * Business Intelligence
  * GIS Tools
  * ...

Statistical Programming
~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~

.. Writing Tip:
  Address user questions of "What does the application do?",
  "When would I use it?", "Why would I use it over other applications?",
  "How mature is the application and how widely deployed is it?".
  Don't mention licence or open source in this section.
  Target audience is a GIS practitioner or student who is new to Open Source.
  
R is a leading Open Source statistical program/programming language for computation and graphics.

The Spatial Task View is a collection or R packages focused on handling, analysing and displaying geographic datasets. Many of the most commonly used Geospatial packages have been included on the live dvd to augement the default R installation.

.. Writing Tip:
  Provide a image of the application which will typically be a screen shot
  or a collage of screen shots.
  Store image in image/<application>_<name>.gif . Eg: udig_main_page.gif
  Screenshots should be captured from a 1024x768 display.
  Don't include the desktop background as this changes with each release
  and will become dated.
