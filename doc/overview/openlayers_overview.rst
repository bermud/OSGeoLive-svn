OpenLayers
==========

OpenLayers makes it easy to put a dynamic map in any web page. It can display
map tiles and markers loaded from any source. OpenLayers is a pure JavaScript
library for displaying map data in most modern web browsers, with no
server-side dependencies. OpenLayers implements a JavaScript API for building
rich web-based geographic applications, similar to the Google Maps API.

Furthermore, OpenLayers implements industry-standard methods for geographic
data access, such as the OpenGIS Consortium's Web Mapping Service (WMS) and Web
Feature Service (WFS) protocols. Under the hood, OpenLayers is written in
object-oriented JavaScript.

As a framework, OpenLayers is intended to separate map tools from map data so
that all the tools can operate on all the data sources. This separation breaks
the proprietary silos that earlier GIS revolutions have taught civilization to
avoid. The mapping revolution on the public Web should benefit from the
experience of history.
