MapFish
=======

Web Mapping Framework
~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~

MapFish is a flexible and complete framework for building rich web-mapping
applications. It emphasizes high productivity, and high-quality development. 

MapFish is based on the `Pylons <http://pylonshq.com>`_ Python web framework.
MapFish extends Pylons with geospatial-specific functionality. For example
MapFish provides specific tools for creating web services that allows querying
and editing geographic objects.

MapFish also provides a complete RIA-oriented JavaScript toolbox, a JavaScript
testing environment, and tools for compressing JavaScript code. The JavaScript
toolbox is composed of the `ExtJS <http://extjs.com>`_, `OpenLayers
<http://www.openlayers.org>`_ , `GeoExt <http://www.geoext.org>`_ JavaScript
toolkits, and specific components for interacting with MapFish web services.

Core Features
-------------

The MapFish framework is built around an open HTTP-based protocol, allowing
various interoperable implementations. In addition to the reference
implementation provided by the Python/Pylons-based framework, two other
implementations are currently available:

    * a Ruby/Rails plugin (GPLv3)
    * a PHP/Symfony plugin (BSD)

See the documentation for more information.

Implemented Standards
---------------------

MapFish is compliant with the `Open Geospatial Consortium <http://www.opengeospatial.org/>`_ standards.
This is achieved through OpenLayers or GeoExt supporting several OGC norms, like
WMS, WFS, WMC, KML, GML etc..
