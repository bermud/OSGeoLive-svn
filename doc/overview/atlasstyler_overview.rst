AtlasStyler
============

About AtlasStyler
~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~

`AtlasStyler <http://en.geopublishing.org/AtlasStyler>`_ is a user-friendly desktop application to style geodata. The resulting styles can be saved to XML files that follow the OGC SLD/SE standard 1.0.
The created SLD files are compatibel with GeoServer, uDig, Geotools-based applications and all other programs that use the OGC SLD standard. The application provides a multiplicity of intuitive dialogs that allow to create styles productively - without dealing with any XML. You can apply abstract classifications like unique values, colored quantiles or equal distance. Additionally you have integrated access to an online symbol-database. You can create and save symbols in the SymbolEditor and reuse you symbols in classifications or other projects.
