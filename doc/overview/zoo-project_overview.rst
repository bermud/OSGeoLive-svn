ZOO Project
=========

ZOO Project provides an OGC WPS compliant developer-friendly framework supporting many programming languages. Two demo applications using simple spatialtools Services Providers (a C shared library and a Python module) based on the GEOS and OGR Libraries.

WPS Server
~~~~~~~~~~~

ZOO is a WPS (Web Processing Service) open source project released under a MIT/X-11 style license . It provides an OGC WPS compliant developer-friendly framework to create and chain WPS Web services. ZOO is made of three parts:
 
ZOO Kernel : A powerful server-side C Kernel which makes it possible to manage and chain Web services coded in different programming languages. 
ZOO Services : A growing suite of example Web services based on various Open Source libraries. (get inspired !) 
ZOO API : A server-side JavaScript API able to call and chain the ZOO Services, which makes the development and chaining processes easier. 

ZOO is based on a 'WPS Service Kernel' which constitutes the ZOO's core system (aka ZOO Kernel). The latter is able to load dynamic libraries and to handle them as on-demand Web services. The ZOO Kernel is written in C language, but supports several common programming languages in order to connect to numerous libraries and above all to simplify the Web service end-developer's job.

A ZOO service is a link composed of a metadata file (.zcfg) and the code for the corresponding implementation. The metadata file describes all the available functions which can be called using a WPS Exec Request, as well as the desired input/output. Services contain the algorithms and functions, and can now be implemented in C/C++, Fortran, Java, Python, PHP and JavaScript.
