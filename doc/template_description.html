<h2>About</h2>
<p>
  <a href="http://grass.osgeo.org">GRASS</a> (Geographic Resources Analysis
  Support System) is a raster/vector GIS, image processing system, and graphics
  production system. GRASS contains over 350 programs and tools to render maps
  and images on monitor and paper; manipulate raster, vector, and sites data;
  process multi spectral image data; and create, manage, and store spatial data.
  GRASS uses both an intuitive windows interface as well as command line syntax
  for ease of operations. GRASS can interface with commercial printers,
  plotters, digitizers, and databases to develop new data as well as manage
  existing data.</p>
