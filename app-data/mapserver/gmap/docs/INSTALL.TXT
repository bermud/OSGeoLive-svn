
GMap PHP/MapScript demo installation instructions
=================================================

REQUIREMENTS FOR PHP/MAPSCRIPT:
===============================

In addition to the data files and other files in the 'gmap' sub-directory,
you need the following in order to run this PHP/MapScript application on 
your server:

  - Apache HTTP server with PHP 3.0.14 or newer must be installed
  - The PHP/Mapscript extension (php3_mapscript.dll on Windows, or 
    php_mapscript.so on Unix) must be installed.

Note: The main gmap75.phtml script loads the php_mapscript library using 
      a dl() call.  If your php.ini file already contains an 
      extension=php_mapscript.so line to automatically preload the
      php_mapscript.so/.dll library, then you should remove the dl() call
      at the top of the gmap75.phtml

INSTALLATION:
=============

- Install the gmap directory and sub-directories on your system, while making
  sure that the directory structure is maintained:

     gmap
       +- data
       +- htdocs
       |     +- images
       +- etc
       +- docs

- Create the temporary image output directory: /tmp/ms_tmp/
  On Unix:
    Simply create it under '/tmp/ms_tmp/'.
    Make sure the httpd user (usually 'nobody') has write access to that
    directory.
  On Windows: Create a 'tmp' directory on the same
    Create a 'TMP' directory in the root of the drive where the 'gmap'
    directory was installed, and create 'MS_TMP' under that directory.

- Create aliases in the Apache configuration to make the application
  directories visible to web users:
  On Unix:
    Alias /gmap/   "/path/to/gmap/htdocs/"
    Alias /ms_tmp/ "/tmp/ms_tmp/"
  On Windows:
    Alias /gmap/   "D:/path/to/gmap/htdocs/"
    Alias /ms_tmp/ "D:/tmp/ms_tmp/"

  Note: Make sure that you replace the /path/to/gmap/ with the value
        corresponding to your installation.

- Restart Apache for the changes to take effect.

TRY IT OUT:
===========

- Access the file gmap75.phtml with your web browser and enjoy!
